  - title: 'Designing & Developing the Urbany App - What We Have Learned'
    name: Georgi Kobilarov and Philipp Steinacher
    description: >-
      Urbany is a new iPhone App we launched last week

            that integrates many of your favorite location apps into one
      interface.

            <a
      href="http://netzwertig.com/2012/02/08/cafe-restaurant-und-ausgehtipps-urbany

            -ist-das-ultimative-empfehlungs-mashup/">Netzwertig.com</a> called it
      &quot;the ultimate location mashup&quot;. In this talk we will share our
      experiences designing and developing Urbany.

            We will walk you through the rationale of some of our design
      decisions

            (both the intentional and the incidental ones), we will talk about

            climbing to top of the travel category in the German App Store in
      just

            48 hours, and we will confuse correlation with causation a lot.

  - title: The dark mysteries of the Chrome DevTools
    name: Alex Feyerke
    desc: 'If you&#x2019;ve never ventured further than console.log() and your general notion of DevTools and Firebug is &#x201C;yeah, this is neat, but it could be a lot neater&#x201D;, then this is for you. Useful functions you&#x2019;d never stumble across on your own and more keyboard shortcuts than you can shake a stick at.'
