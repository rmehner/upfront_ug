Most importantly of all sheâ€™ll show you how easy and fun it can be to get your own static sites out into the wild.'
    bio: 'After contracting as a front-end developer in London, and writing code for the front page of BBC News, Charlie Owen is now happily working as a senior FED for Springer Nature in Berlin. There she helps make the world of scientific publishing a better place by constructing design systems, banging on about inclusive design, and utilising those wonderful web standards. She rides bikes, drinks beer, and quite often says the wrong thing at the wrong time.'
