  - title: 'Design Processes, Not Interfaces'
    name: Tiffany Conroy
    description: >-
      Computers are tools that help people accomplish tasks by making the process
      easier, faster, cheaper, less error-prone, or just more fun.

            But what tasks? And by what process? What parts of the process can
      the computer make better? How can users interact with the computer to make
      it do its part of the process? Only lastly can we ask: what must be
      presented to the user and how?
    bio: Tiffany is a Canadian living in Berlin doing front-end development and interaction design at SoundCloud.
