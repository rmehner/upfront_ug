    title: 'Navigating Visual Trends'
    picture: 'francesco-bianchi.jpg'
    desc: 'The visual design landscape is in constant motion. Every year new trends emerge shaping new visual aesthetics, UI animations, and navigation patterns. As designers we are unavoidably influenced by them â€“consciously or not â€“ and often dragged into the discussion about whether to adopt or avoid them. Taking part in this discussion is not only a matter of creativity but implies a broader view that includes questions such as: what do these trends mean in terms of the user experience? How are they perceived outside the design community? And finally, what are the guiding principles while tackling and analyzing these trends?'
    bio: 'Francesco Bianchi is a Visual-Interaction designer at Edenspiekermann Berlin, a global design and consulting firm driven by brand, content and technology. Previously, Francesco worked also at Leftloft (Milan) and Landor (Hamburg). He graduated in Politecnico di Milano and participated in the Data-Shack Program at Harvard University. His work explores and combines different fields, from user experience to graphic design, coding and data visualization.'

    picture: 'juliusx2.jpg'
