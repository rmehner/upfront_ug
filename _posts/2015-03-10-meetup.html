intro: >
  Wow, it&#x2019;s March already. We have of course an up.front meetup planned!
  We happily announce two amzing talks for the next second Tuesday, March 10th!

    <br><br>

    After our amazing and well attended meetup in February, where Johan
  Dettmar&#x2019;s talk &#x201C;Creativity How?&#x201D; inspired us all, this
  month it is Virginie Caplet&#x2019;s turn to tell us about another aspect of
  the matter that affects us all time and again: Creativity blocks. Danila
  reminds us of an old but proven mind-set for better learning. And as
  a last-minute surprise guest, Ben Schwarz will tell us about performance
  metrics.<br>

    Last but not least: Kristina is back from San Francisco and we would love
  celebrate this together. So tell all your colleagues and friends and join us!

talks:
  - title: Moving the creativity blocks
    name: Vi Caplet
    desc: 'Creativity had become a must-have quality in most jobs nowadays. However we sometimes witness we are unable to put ideas and solutions into action. This is what we call creativity blocks. Let&#x2019;s learn to identify the blocking situations as early as possible in order to finally kick their asses.'
    bio: 'Vi is a product designer @Babbel. She nourishes an obsession for problem solving, brain hacking, panda hugging and cookies baking.'

  - title: 'Learn to code - The punk rock way!'
    name: Danila Pellicani
    desc: 'Learning is always hard work, learn to code is even harder, especially if you want to do it on your own. We&#x2019;ll stage dive on the punk rock culture to understand how the DIY attitude can help you learning and can give you the freedom to do whatever you want!'
    bio: 'Danila is an Interaction Designer, occasional coder and open source design advocate. When she&#x2019;s not in front of a screen she&#x2019;s probably stage diving at a punk rock show!'

  - title: Useful Performance Metrics
    name: Ben Schwarz
    desc: 'Building a super-performant front-end is far harder and more intensive than making onLoad or onDomReady happen quicker &#x2014; After you&#x2019;ve removed &#x201C;blocking scripts&#x201D;, what do you do? In this talk Ben will show you how to put best practice tools to work for you &amp; your team.'
    bio: 'Ben is a Melbourne based web developer, speaker and event organiser. He&#x2019;s a director of <a href="http://2015.cssconf.com.au/">CSSConfAU</a>, works on <a href="https://calibreapp.com/">CalibreApp</a> and spends the rest his time cycling and drinking unsettling amounts of booze and coffee.'
