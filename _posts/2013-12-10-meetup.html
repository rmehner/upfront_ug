talks:
  - title: CSS â€“ Best Practices and Maintainability
    name: Regine Heidorn
    desc: 'While working with precompilers and CSS frameworks one often gets to reflect about the necessity of programming language features within CSS. Looking at the CSS basics like cascade and inheritance helps to get a better understanding of writing good cascading stylesheets. We can see some artifacts remaining from the print era, but we can also put a spotlight on how great CSS can be used. Regine will discuss the following thesis: Everything that helps the browser to interpret CSS in a performant way also helps developers to write better, more maintainable code and facilitates a smoother workflow. If you ever were curious as to why the :hover in CSS works this talk will be perfect for you.'
    bio: 'Passionate frontend developer, author of CSS &#x2013; Best Practices und Wartbarkeit (German only). Will bring some copies.'

  - title: Building shapeshifting interfaces
    name: Frank Leue

      Building things on the web is great. Especially just now as responsive
      design solved lots of our problems. But taking a glimpse at the near future
      you&#x2019;ll see not only desktops, tablets and phones. There will be
      watches and super large TV sets. Interaction with those devices will not
      necessarily include your fingertips anymore but very likely gestures and
      voice control.

          While the emerging internet of things is going to surround us with
      connected devices constantly providing or collecting data, we need to think
      about how to build consistent experiences throughout the day.

          This talk is about how to build frontends that adopt to contexts and
      provide consistent information and a continuity of your brand across
      devices.
    bio: 'Frank is a Berlin-based web enthusiast. Crafting code for frontends and backends has been his passion since 1997. Working on the web provides him endless opportunities to express creativity, and put some bright moments in other peoples&#x2019; life. He&#x2019;s currently Technical Director at Hi-ReS! Berlin.'

  - title: A Presentation About Presenting
    name: Michael Pieracci
    desc: 'Throughout his life Michael has always struggled to explain his work and hobbies in clear and concise ways. &quot;You work where?&quot; &quot;What does your company do?&quot; &quot;You like &apos;tea&apos;?&quot; One of his favorite ways to deliver detailed, complete, and clear information is through presenting. By creating a presentation he can deliver information in a tailored way for the topic and the audience. Michael encourages others to find their niche and develop their voice through presenting too.'
    bio: Michael Pieracci lived in San Francisco for the last 8 years doing project and event management at FontShop. He recently moved to Berlin and is on the hunt for new opportunities.
