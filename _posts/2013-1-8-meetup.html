    <h4>Skeumorphic Mess vs the Boring Flatlands: What’s a “Digitally Native User Interface”?</h4>
    <p>
Over the past years, we’ve witnessed a constant debate about competing trends in our field: Mimicking real world objects in user interfaces versus a revived flat approach, which the proponents label as more content-focused, <i>digitally native</i> and even <i>honest</i>.
    <br>
It’s time to put this into perspective. Is there more to this new flat trend than just a different level of polish and angry designer youth re-discovering modernism? How can a user interface be native and honest in the first place?
    <br>

We’ll look at different approaches and whether they’re relevant. To get a broader contexts of terms used in the discussion, we’ll not only discuss interaction design and usability, but also will have a look at art history and architecture.
