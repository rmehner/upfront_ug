  - title: A Video Game Revolution is Happeningâ€¦ In Your Browser
    name: Lorenzo Pilia and Jerry Belich

A more recent phenomenon though is the emergence of browser-based game making tools, such as Twine and PuzzleScript, which are allowing people (non-coders in particular) to easily develop and share their creations. In this presentation we&#x2019;re going to find out why that&#x2019;s revolutionary (hint: it has to do with diversity) and get to know the Choosatron Deluxe Adventure Matrix, an interactive fiction arcade machine that provides players a tangible artifact from their unique journey through one of its stories.'

He&#x2019;s the A MAZE. / Berlin 2014 festival program manager and organises the bi-monthly Talk &amp; Play meetup.
