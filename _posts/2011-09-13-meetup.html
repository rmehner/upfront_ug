  - title: Branding in App Design
    name: Max Fellmuth
    desc: 'Every company thinks about how to present their app. But is it more important to present the company&#x2019;s style or to make an app that looks good on its platform? Is it more important to have a light blue status bar or to have one that doesn&#x2019;t break your own guidelines. That&#x2019;s what Max Fellmuth wants to discuss with you.
