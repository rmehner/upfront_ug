    desc: 'In Kathrin’s talk the audience will learn one way to set up and work with a design system with the help of React and Storybook. The talk starts with the idea behind using a design system. It focuses on how the setup with Storybook as a development environment is working. It also shows some hands-on examples on how to build and use components with it.'

    title: 'The Art and Craft of Workshop Facilitation'

    desc: 'Design workshops are one of the most important assets in the designer’s toolkit, but do we give them enough credit and attention? Meetings design is a craft in itself and requires a diverse skillset - from experience design to psychology and understanding group dynamics. Magda will share a bit of a context of why these different skills matter (and why it’s not just about inviting different people and giving them the agenda) and let the audience learn from her experience (and past mistakes). If you ever struggled with making the participants involved in a co-creative design session or if you prefer to just stay at your computer and gather the feedback from others on Slack - this talk is for you.'
    bio: 'Since 2013, Magda has led various UX projects and processes, co-managed a digital strategy for a governmental culture institution and designed her own framework of a service design sprint for an aviation agency. With 5+ years of experience in designing digital experiences, she holds a skillset combined of design techniques, technical and programming skills and passion for psychology.'

    desc: 'Web development is a constant journey of new technologies and new things to learn. A year ago Stefan started documenting and sharing all the tiny things that he didn’t know before and stopped being anxious about others thinking that he’s not smart. In this talk he’ll tell you what he learned!'
    bio: 'Stefan started programming 7 years ago and quickly fell in love with web performance, new technologies, and accessibility. He is also a curator of the web performance online resource Perf Tooling, organizer of the Web Performance Meetup Berlin, contributes to a variety of open source projects and enjoys sharing nerdy discoveries.'
