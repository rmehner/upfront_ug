      desc: 'Visually testing a demanding design for the frontend is *really* hard - especially when it comes to cross-device, pixel-perfect quality management. We came up with a bunch of tricks and an open source solution to tame the beast for everyone on the team.'
      bio: 'Steffen is working as a lead developer for the berlin-based digital agency Taikonauten. He’s been in the web game for 18 years and he loves automation and optimization. He also randomly twitters complete nonsense.'

   - name: 'Ivana McConnell'
      title: 'Technology, community, and code: building an inclusive UX'

      desc: 'In this talk, Ivana will describe how we use tech to build our identities and figure out who we are. We need to be aware of our role as developers and designers in shaping identities as we build our products. It’s critical to understand how code creates communities, online and offline, and how those will be experienced by minorities and the underrepresented— does it marginalise them? Does it enable them to be successful? Let’s learn about those responsibilities, how to be aware of them, and how to build better tech in the process.'
      bio: 'Ivana is a UI/UX designer, born in Sarajevo to a civil engineer-turned-translator and a UN Logistics Officer-turned-software engineer. She fell in love with the web on Geocities and Neopets, and is now based in Vancouver working for Customer.io.'
