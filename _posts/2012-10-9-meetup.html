intro: >
  And we&#x2019;re back! Our 30th meetup is drawing ever closer, and with it,
  our collective mid-life crisis. But fear not, Berlin&#x2019;s dazzling tech
  scene is currently spoiling us with amazing conferences (jsconf.eu and
  reject.js, and there&#x2019;s Javascript helicopters in there somewhere as
  well) and attracting smart beings from all around the globe, some of which will
  be speaking at up.front! This one should be excellent.

   Hover into co.up&#x2019;s third floor at 7:30 for talks and general
  interestingness, and join us later at <a

  for casual lounging and tasty, discounted drinks.
