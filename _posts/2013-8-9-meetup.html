  We have one more speaker slot! Write us on <a href="http://twitter.com/upfront_ug">twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:kriesse@upfront.ug">send us an email</a> if you have a design or frontend topic to discuss, or if you have a speaker to suggest.

<p>
  It’s the summer edition of up.front! In the summer, many of us try to take some time off and maybe reflect on the things we do. We would like to pick up on that theme, with two personal talks, aimed to help us define ourselves as professionals, freelancers, designers or developers, and maybe as humans.
</p>
<p>
  We hope this will spur a lot of discussion, and as usual, after the talks there’s time for conversations and tasty, discounted drinks at <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/aapKr">Lugosi</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Up.front is a free event, and you do not have to register anywhere. However it gets packed sometimes. Doors open at 7pm, talks do not start before 7:30pm. Come early to make sure you get a seat!

    <h4><span>Sven Ellingen:</span> Always be Building</h4>
    <p>
      Sven loves to start things. And then grow them. Ideas, things, projects, products, teams. And lately: a company — after 5 years at Edenspiekermann, he decided to start from scratch, on his own. This talk is about leaving something great behind to make room for something that’s even better. It’s essentially about the beauty of building things.
    </p>
    <p class="speaker_info">
      Sven is a designer bridging disciplines across business, design, and technology. Co-founder of @acolorbright. Previously: Creative Director at @edenspiekermann.

    <h4><span>Kilian McMahon:</span> Embracing what you're not</h4>
    <p>
      Kilian has spent the last couple of years fumbling around as a designer trying to figure out how to become the people he admired but to no avail. This talk is about getting away from the idea of fitting yourself to others, recognising that you don't work like everyone else and understanding that being different is so much better.
    </p>
    <p class="speaker_info">
      Kilian is a designer from Dublin who works on a ticketing app called Tito and a conference called Úll.
