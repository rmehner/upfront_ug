     <h4><span>Karolina Szczur</span> Designing with Color</h4>
     <p>
       “There’s more to color than a swatch in a book” – a wise man said once. Color is one of the most powerful, emotion evoking weapon in designer’s toolbelt, yet sometimes we fail to recognize its importance. From perception, psychological and cultural meaning of color to systems, optical illusions, usability restraints and useful tools.

       Karolina is a designer and front-end developer. She worked with numerous startups, curated a lesson at Hack Design course and helps out as an editor at Smashing Mag.

     <h4><span>Cath Richardson</span> Embracing the mundane</h4>
     <p>
       Sometimes to make something amazing, you have to start with something boring. This talk is about embracing the mundane problems which surround us everyday. Thermostats, workflows, print infrastructure – we’ll look at how fundamentally dull, pedestrian things can turn into the most fascinating and rewarding design challenges.

     <p class="speaker_info">
       A reformed Londoner, Cath moved to Berlin this year after 2 years working in service design and customer development at Made by Many. She now leads product at ezeep, a company changing the way the world prints.

     <h4><span>Natalia Berdys</span> The web experience in the autistic spectrum</h4>
     <p>
       Designing with cognitively-impaired users in mind can be very illuminative, leading to a broader understanding of the role of UX/UI design in general. In her talk, Natalia will focus on Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism, the perceptual issues involved for such web audience, and how their web experience can be the most sensitive test of good design.

       Natalia Berdys develops iOS apps, plays a lot of video games and gets high on information. She’s obsessively interested in language, numbers and hardware. Pinkish hair, oddball ideas.

   <h4><span>Paulo Zoom</span> Words of Matter</h4>
   <p>
     Words are living things. We shape them with our collective usage, and we perceive them differently as we change. As people, they’re our interface with one another. And as designers, our most essential tool.
   <br>
     In this talk, Paulo will explore how words impact our interfaces, affect our users’ behavior, and have the power to surprise and delight, but also to annoy and frustrate.
   </p>
   <p class="speaker_info">
     Paulo designs websites. He’s working on <a href="http://everywhere.alwaysreadthemanual.com">The Manual</a> and <a href="http://xoxofest.com">XOXO</a>. That’s not his real name.

   <h4><span>Hany Rizk</span> UX &amp; Product: How lean can you go?</h4>
   <p>
     F**k it, ship it they say &mdash; but does that also apply when you’re working on a completely new product? This talk will revolve around releasing a Minimal Viable Product and all the complications that come with it: How do you know when your MVP is ready, and is less really more?
   </p>
   <p class="speaker_info">
     Hany is a UX and Interaction Designer driven by minimalism, product strategy and bringing interaction beyond the screen. As a pianist with a passion for music, design, arts and humanities, Hany mixes those sources of inspiration with the technical challenges he faces to design intuitive and innovative solutions that are fun to use, shaken not stirred!

  At our April meetup, we had talks by Emma Rose Metcalfe, Tom O’Doherty and John Sebastian Hussey.

<ul class="talks">
  <li>
    <h4><span>Emma Rose Metcalfe</span>Social Objects - the centre of our universe</h4>
    <p>
    Whether it’s photo sharing, loops or tweets, the social object reigns queen of the web. Starting with Jyri Engeström as our centre point I’ll walk through findings from our own development in seeking the balance between accessible and precious design around social objects. How can we design platforms that lower barriers to create objects with long term social value?
    </p>

    Emma Rose Metcalfe is a designer and co-founder of HowDo, a mobile platform where people capture, collect and share micro guides about the world around them. She heads up the product team and has a background in service and experience design.
