  - title: Designing with Color
    name: Karolina Szczur
    desc: '&#x201C;There&#x2019;s more to color than a swatch in a book&#x201D; &#x2013; a wise man said once. Color is one of the most powerful, emotion evoking weapon in designer&#x2019;s toolbelt, yet sometimes we fail to recognize its importance. From perception, psychological and cultural meaning of color to systems, optical illusions, usability restraints and useful tools.'
    bio: 'Karolina is a designer and front-end developer. She worked with numerous startups, curated a lesson at Hack Design course and helps out as an editor at Smashing Mag.'

  - title: Embracing the mundane
    name: Cath Richardson
    desc: 'Sometimes to make something amazing, you have to start with something boring. This talk is about embracing the mundane problems which surround us everyday. Thermostats, workflows, print infrastructure &#x2013; we&#x2019;ll look at how fundamentally dull, pedestrian things can turn into the most fascinating and rewarding design challenges.'
    bio: 'A reformed Londoner, Cath moved to Berlin this year after 2 years working in service design and customer development at Made by Many. She now leads product at ezeep, a company changing the way the world prints.'

  - title: The web experience in the autistic spectrum
    name: Natalia Berdys
    desc: 'Designing with cognitively-impaired users in mind can be very illuminative, leading to a broader understanding of the role of UX/UI design in general. In her talk, Natalia will focus on Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism, the perceptual issues involved for such web audience, and how their web experience can be the most sensitive test of good design.'
    bio: 'Natalia Berdys develops iOS apps, plays a lot of video games and gets high on information. She&#x2019;s obsessively interested in language, numbers and hardware. Pinkish hair, oddball ideas.'
