  intro: 'Boo! Hah, surprise! We’re doing a sneaky late-but-intense sort of announcement! Because it’s the fourth month of the year, we have four speakers for you! No, that’s not the reason, that would become unsustainable very quickly. Anyway, up.front tonight, tell all your friends, because we haven’t really gotten around to it this time. See you all at up.front 74 on Tuesday, April 11th. Here’s what we’ve got for you this time:'

    - name: 'L Daniel Swakman'
      title: 'Add to home screen: Designing & prototyping a native app in HTML'
      picture: 'l-daniel-swakman.jpg'
      desc: 'In this talk, Daniel will talk about bridging the gap between web design/frontend and designing for native iOS/Android. He makes the case that designers need to come out of their Sketch cage, and start delivering stateful & dynamic (responsive) designs. This theme will be illustrated through the case study of designing the mobile app for SME-accounting startup Paraşüt fully through prototype-ready HTML, CSS and a Github repository.'
      bio: 'Daniel is a ‘full stack’ web & UI designer, passionate about creating meaningful and legible content experiences through design. He is originally from Amsterdam, previously in Istanbul, occasionally London and currently in Berlin. Europe basically. Daniel believes that designing delightful experiences for digital means an inevitable link between design and code.'

      desc: 'You want to make your webapp robust in this dizzyingly diverse world of devices, connections and browsers, right? What if I told you that doing so might just make you a better person? Join me as I tell you about technology, morality, and how they intersect.'
      bio: 'Charlie came to Berlin to escape the horrors of London, and found herself at home in this beautifully weird city.

Having experience in the non-profit and private sectors, he has been a speaker and facilitator in more than 50 events in the last 5 years.
