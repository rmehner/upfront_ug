  - title: The letter ß
    name: Nadine Roßa
    desc: >-
      For some people it is a trouble-maker in German orthography, for some
      a shortcoming in typography but to Nadine it is the most beautiful letter
      &#x2013; The German Eszett.

            Throughout history no other character has had to put up with so much
      and almost no other letter has been the subject of so much discussion. Her
      surname contains this rare character. That&#x2019;s the reason why, in her
      thesis, she decided to put some thought into what could be done to place it
      in a better light. That was the basis of the project &#xBB;Eine scharfe
      Type&#xAB; &#x2013; A sharp character.

  - title: FontFont.com – A more agile design process
    name: Sven Ellingen

      Sven &#x2013; Designer at Edenspiekermann &#x2013; will give some insight
      on the recently relaunched <a href="http://fontfont.com/">fontfont.com</a>.
      FontFont is the world&#x2019;s largest library of original contemporary
      typefaces. Together with Ivo Gabrowitsch and J&#xF6;rg Haubrichs, head of
      marketing and developer at FontFont, the team at Edenspiekermann redesigned
      the website from scratch in a collaborative and agile way. Almost no
      Photoshop pixels were harmed in the making of the site. Instead, most of
      the design took place in the browser using tools such as Haml and Sass.
