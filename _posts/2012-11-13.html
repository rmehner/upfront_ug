talks:
  - title: Designing for the way they shape our world
    name: Martijn Schreuder
    desc: 'All over the world, charities and social initiatives make sure we have a clean, social and livable today and tomorrow. And sometimes they reach the boundaries of the expertise that their members can provide or that they can afford. Providing such expertise pro bono can be a deciding push forward. The GiveCamp is meant to provide such expertise in a specific field: technology and design. Ten Berlin non-profits will meet at RallyPad for one weekend with 30-50 developers and designers to create market quality solutions.'
    bio: 'Martijn is a neuroscientist at TU-Berlin, founder of pro bono platform Talentspender and co-organizer of the first GiveCamp here in Berlin.'

  - title: CSS preprocessors to do the dirty work
    name: Gunnar Bittersmann
    desc: 'This talk covers how CSS preprocessors can help with what every web devoloper hates: supporting legacy IE, and with what every web devoloper should hate: OOCSS. He&#x2019;ll discuss its downsides and how we could do better to achieve its goals.'
    bio: 'Gunnar is a frontend developer at brands4friends, helps organizing the annual World Usability Day Berlin, and translates articles on the W3C i18n website.'
