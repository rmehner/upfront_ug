  talks:
    - name: 'Ally Long'
      title: 'Tech newbies? Where does one find them?'
      picture: ''
      desc: "It's not easy, even in the developing world, to find people who don't use a smartphone. But they're out there, and Ally has been making mobile apps for some of these novice tech users in various West African countries. In this talk she'll share some of the lessons she's learnt along the way about how people who've been introduced to technology very recently - usually through cheap, second-hand, car-battery-powered devices - respond to new and shiny ways of interacting with machines."
      bio: 'Ally is a designer and front-end developer at eHealth Africa. She splits her time there between creating mobile app interfaces for novice tech users in West Africa, and designing data visualisations for disease surveillance dashboards.'

    - name: 'Florian Stolzenhain'
      title: 'Hating Bootstrap Properly'
      picture: ''
      desc: 'This was supposed to be a rant but by realizing you can only despise things you actually have some relation to I’d rather analyze the context of Bootstrap and frontend frameworks in general. This talk will feature opinions about: gut feeling, putting yourself in someone else’s position, and negative margins.'
      bio: 'Florian is a graphic designer turned frontend nerd and Drupal sitebuilder. He is a co-founder of <a href="http://formundkonzept.de">FUK</a> and works at Compuccino.'
