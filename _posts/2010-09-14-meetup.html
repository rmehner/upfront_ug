      For once, Apple may have actually gotten it right with their

            advertising: The iPhone 4 changed everything. At least, if
      you&#x2019;re an

            interface designer. Dealing with different resolutions and screen

            sizes adds another dimension to both conceptual and technical

            interface design. My talk provides some basic thoughts and
      approaches

            concerning this issue.
