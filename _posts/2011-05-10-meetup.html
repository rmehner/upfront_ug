  - title: Cure for the Common Font — A Web Designer’s Introduction to Typeface Selection
    name: Stephen Coles

After six years at FontShop San Francisco as a creative director, he now publishes the websites Typographica, Fonts In Use, and The Mid-Century Modernist.

  - title: Taking print design online
    name: Gearóid O’Rourke
    desc: >-
      Newspapers are dying. Print is dead. All hail the online revolution! It has
      felled the inky beasts. Oh the confidence of teenagers. Web design is
      a discipline in it&#x2019;s adolescence &#x2014; the classic teenager; all
      existential angst, bad fashion choices, mood swings and earnest attempts at
      &#x201C;cool&#x201D;. It has rightly rejected the mistakes, constraints and
      pitfalls of &#x201C;fuddy-duddy&#x201D; print design, but has forgotten
      that old-man print still has more than a few things to teach.<br>

          Gear&#xF3;id spent his teenage years in the world of newspapers. As the
      youngest designer at Ireland&#x2019;s oldest newspaper he learned print
      design from the old hands. Teaching himself web design at the same time, he
      became fascinated by the insights a grounding in print design can offer to
      the web designer who is willing to listen. Gear&#xF3;id will explore these
      insights under 3 headings &#x2013; process, philosophy and practicalities.
    bio: 'Gear&#xF3;id is a 24 year-old Irish guy who runs a one-man design studio in London. He has worked as an editorial designer with the News of the World, The Irish Times and the Sun. He welcomes our new online overlords in &#x201C;the cloud&#x201D;.'
