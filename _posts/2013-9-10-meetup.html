      Leila loves to tell stories. Stories about journeys, city walks and people she meets. So Leila turned her love of story telling into a way for Brands to tell their story. This talk is about how the best stories start with experiences and how technology can be used to share them.

      Have you read the crazy stuff in the CSSOM spec!? There is some super interesting stuff in there. Come over here and let Tiffany show you some pretty neat things she learned, and some fun things she made.

      What happens when innovation in technology is faster than your ability to learn new skills? What happens to the design process in a world of planned obsolescence? This talk will help you to slow down things (a bit) and see them from another perspective.

    <h4><span>Angelina Fabbro:</span> Firefox OS: It's coming, it's here.</h4>

    <p>
      Firefox OS is a brand new open mobile platform built with web technology that front end developers are already familiar with. In this talk I will explain the benefits of developing for this platform (even if you don't reside in one of the first launch countries) as well as demonstrate how easy it is to get started from the perspective of a front-end developer. Light live demo to be provided to show the simulator in action.
