  - title: Design Tools
    name: Uli Sch√∂berl
    desc: 'Whenever Tools of choice are discussed its easy to start off a heated debate. Its 2011 and Websites are still started in Photoshop. We laughed at the print people using InDesign, now it ships with pixel measures and we dream about the automatic recovery when Fireworks beachball crashed again. And of course beyond Adobe, who needs a flat demo of an interactive Design anyways, after all rapid prototyping has been around a while.<br>&gt;His talk will showcase different case of Tool combinations, how they fit in a real world workflow and the own choice always seems superior to everyone elses. A heated debate will follow.'
