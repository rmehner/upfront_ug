  - title: 'CSS, Interfaces and What We Can Do About It'
    name: 'Martin Klepsch'
    desc: '
      When HTML was first formulated it was strongly influenced by
      a documentation format used at CERN. It then often contained information
      about the visual appearance of documents which &#x201C;cluttered&#x201D;
      the source with secondary information not relevant to the document&#x2019;s
      content. Soon thereafter CSS was drafted to separate these two concerns.
      Today the web has evolved and it&#x2019;s no longer just a source for
      documents but provides rich interfaces to consume and create a wide variety
      of content.
      Still, the underlying mechanics to build these interfaces
      haven&#x2019;t changed much, and complex, responsive layouts require
      significant effort and code that is not always easy grasp.
      Let&#x2019;s take a look at a different approach and how we might be
      able to level up our toolset to build complex interfaces for the web.'
