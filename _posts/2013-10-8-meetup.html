  - title: Design Habit
    name: Behrad Mirafshar
    video: //www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PfxFCNhJJvg
    desc: 'Our digital life is bombarded by apps. However, we use few of them on a daily basis. This does not mean that the other apps are not well-designed, this is basically because they fail to make a mark in our life and to create a habit for us. This talk endeavors to explore what we deliver behind our apps.'
    bio: 'Behrad is an UX/UI designer. He always likes to partake in interesting projects. He loves cafes. He is a proud Neuk&#xF6;llner.'

  - title: '“That’s not what I meant”: On empathy in our work'
    name: Francesco Kirchhoff
    video: //www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8fZamEdbFTU
    desc: 'Besides the skills specific to our job, a huge part of building digital products is about communicating with other people. The better we understand our clients, bosses and colleagues, and the better we are at helping them understand us and what we do, the better the project will turn out and the less stress we are likely to generate. Some general thoughts on a more empathetic approach to communication and a list of specific ideas to improve understanding and avoid communication breakdowns.'
    bio: 'Rome-born, Berlin-based Francesco is a caffeine addict who toils away day and sometimes night as a freelance UX designer and project manager for various web agencies and startups in Berlin in order to support his tragic habit. He tries his best not to increase the pervasive ugliness and thoughtlessness, for bad design makes him weep.'
