  talks:
    - name: 'Stefan Judis'
      title: 'Unicode, JavaScript and the Emoji Family'
      picture: 'stefan-judis.jpg'
      desc: 'We all use Emoji in our daily life, but we rarely use them in code. Are there things we have to watch out for? Do Emoji “just work” in JavaScript strings? This talk takes a look at the Emoji family and shows how Unicode works in JavaScript.'
      bio: 'Stefan started programming 6 years ago and quickly fell in love with web performance, new technologies and automation. He worked for several startups in Berlin and recently joined Contentful. He is also a curator of the web performance online resource Perf Tooling (perf-tooling.today), organizer of the Web Performance Meetup Berlin, contributes to a variety of open source projects and enjoys sharing nerdy discoveries.'

    - name: 'Mariko Kosaka'
      title: 'So you tell me my website is slow… the science of what makes snappy interaction.'
      picture: 'mariko-kosaka.jpg'
      desc: 'How do we design a website that feels snappy? When a user says “That website is slow”, what does it really mean? Let’s look at the science of user interaction. You may know the 60fps rule for animation, but how many seconds can a user wait for loading data before they feel frustrated? How can we test if our website feels snappy on a mobile phone with slow network? This talk will guide you through what to look for and how to measure user interaction for web performance so you can start the conversation with other designers and engineers about interaction design.'
      bio: 'Mariko is a creative developer. She uses code to help her design textiles & organize a local JavaScript meetup in New York City called BrooklynJS.'

    - name: 'Glen Maddern'
      title: 'The Front End Dead End'
      picture: 'glen-maddern.jpg'
      desc: 'The front end is a strange place. It’s a totally interdisciplinary field, requiring knowledge of UX, visual design, interaction design, network architecture, device hardware, browser rendering, browser bugs, software architecture & more. There’s so much to learn, and it changes so frequently, how can anyone keep up? And more importantly, if you’re expending so much energy just trying to keep up, how do you grow your skills and progress your career? In this talk, Glen will be sharing his own journey into the front end, and why he decided to start making things to help.'
      bio: 'Glen Maddern is an independent front-end web developer, consultant & educator. He’s the producer of Front End Center, the co-creator of Styled Components & CSS Modules and an organiser of CSSConf AU & JSConf AU.'

      desc: 'Let’s loosen up the web. Let’s make it available to more people with tools we may take for granted — like spreadsheets! In this talk, we’ll cover fatigue-less ways to build things for the web with resources like GitHub Pages, Glitch and Spreadsheets.'
      bio: 'Jessica is an urban designer turned open source developer by way of a year as a Code for America Fellow. She was most recently at GitHub on the Electron team.'
