intro: 'Webfonts seem to be the new savior in webdesign. We are free from Verdana, Helvetica and Georgia, finally! Or actually could be. In fact, one hardly knows anything about the implementation of commercial fonts on the web. I want to give a short introduction to typekit, .woff, .eot &amp; co, but rather want to hear about your opinions and experiences.'

    desc: 'Alex and Sven &#x2013; Developer and Designer at Edenspiekermann &#x2013; will share their experience relaunching the design agency&#x2019;s website in a 2-day-marathon. They&#x2019;ll offer insight into the tools they used, and explain why they kicked out their CMS in favour of a mostly static solution. Learn about the roadblocks they encountered in the last few minutes, and why this rapid reboot is more than just an academic exercise.'
