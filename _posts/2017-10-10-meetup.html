      desc: 'Florian’s talk covers a subjective view on changing frontend practices, their implications on team workflows and how the recent interest in functional CSS can positively impact project maintenance and team communication (whew!).

      desc: 'Even though most of us understand that on the web visuals and code are often two sides of one coin, getting a bunch of designers and developers to work in unison on digital products can be surprisingly tricky. Isn’t there something we can lean on for help? Enter: design systems! This talk will provide a basic introduction to design systems and pattern libraries, focusing on how they can help us to bridge the gaps and optimise workflows within digital teams.'
      bio: 'Liv is a senior frontend developer with Edenspiekermann in Berlin. She cares greatly for design (and designers) and the stuff we all put on the web together.'
