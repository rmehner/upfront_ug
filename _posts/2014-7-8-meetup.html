intro: >
  Upfront time! We&#x2019;re delighted to welcome two wonderful speakers to our
  short-but-brilliant pre-semifinals up.front, which, refreshingly, won&#x2019;t
  be football-themed. Join us for two great talks, cool drinks and general
  milling around and chatting with interesting people. And if you&#x2019;re in
  a footbally mood: we&#x2019;ll wrap up in time for you to commute to your
  favourite bar&#x2009;/&#x2009;public
  square&#x2009;/&#x2009;Sp&#xE4;ti&#x2009;/&#x2009;L&#xE4;ndereck&#x2009;/&#x2009;D&#xF6;nerbude
  in time for kick off.

talks:
  - title: Lessons from the FontShop site relaunch
    name: Spiros Martzoukos
    desc: 'After having worked for months on the Front End part of the new FontShop site relaunch, Spiros has learnt a lot of lessons, solved many problems and created others. He will share how the team used BEM and never looked back at tangled styles and specificity issues, integrated OOCSS and a living style guide in the process, used Angular to quickly set up complex applications within the site and what challenges they faced with Sass loading times.'
    bio: 'Spiros comes from Greece, is half Japanese and works in a German agency, Edenspiekermann, as a Front End Developer. His code is as schizophrenic as that.'

  - title: Design and the Future Interface
    name: Danielle Reid
    desc: 'As technology moves increasingly from the desktop to the pocket - or wrist, interface design must be reimagined. This talk will discuss how we design information for future interfaces and the role that different mediums can play in both creating and consuming content as we&#x2019;re on the go.'
    bio: 'Danielle is a former art director turned entrepreneur, co-founding Capsule.fm and Sterio.me. Both Capsule.fm and Sterio.fm offer new opportunities to design interfaces in the realm of audio technology.'
