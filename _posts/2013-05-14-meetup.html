      Words are living things. We shape them with our collective usage, and we
      perceive them differently as we change. As people, they&#x2019;re our
      interface with one another. And as designers, our most essential tool.

         <br>

           In this talk, Paulo will explore how words impact our interfaces,
      affect our users&#x2019; behavior, and have the power to surprise and
      delight, but also to annoy and frustrate.
