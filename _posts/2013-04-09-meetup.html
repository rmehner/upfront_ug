  - title: Social Objects - the centre of our universe
    name: Emma Rose Metcalfe
    desc: 'Whether it&#x2019;s photo sharing, loops or tweets, the social object reigns queen of the web. Starting with Jyri Engestr&#xF6;m as our centre point I&#x2019;ll walk through findings from our own development in seeking the balance between accessible and precious design around social objects. How can we design platforms that lower barriers to create objects with long term social value?'
    bio: 'Emma Rose Metcalfe is a designer and co-founder of HowDo, a mobile platform where people capture, collect and share micro guides about the world around them. She heads up the product team and has a background in service and experience design.'
