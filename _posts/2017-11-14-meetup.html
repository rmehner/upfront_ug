    desc: 'For centuries, the scientific method has been used to validate all kinds of  hypotheses in various sciences—chemistry, physics, geology, and psychology.  Scientists from different scientific areas use the same core approach to find answers that are logical and supported by evidence. Within our life framework we too explore environment through experimentation. In this talk Vic will draw the parallel between the scientific method and product design, and how it can be introduced into our design workflow.'
    bio: 'Vic is an end-to-end designer who takes interest in psychology, social studies and neuroscience. After taking a psychology course by University of Toronto, she enjoys finding parallels between psychology and design, and introducing them into her work process.'
