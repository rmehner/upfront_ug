  counter:  '72'
  meetup: 'http://www.meetup.com/up-front-ug/'
  intro: 'After a well deserved hibernation season, Up.front is finally back for a row of exciting meetups in 2017: Every 2nd Tuesday at Co.Up, the co.working space of our choice.<br/><br/>

To set the bar for an amazing year to come, we’re very excited to announce our 72nd meetup with a great lineup of three speakers, willing to share with us what they know,  how they came to wrap their head around it and maybe even what they haven’t figured out yet. Let’s listen, put our heads together and discuss frontend, game design and more.'

      desc: '"Performant" and "easy" are not mutually exclusive. In this talk Yosh will explain how to go from writing plain HTML and CSS to running a clean unidirectional JavaScript app. No heavy frontend skills are needed, just a  bit of knowledge in HTML, CSS and JS.'
      bio: 'Yosh is a creative engineer who loves all things computer, but loves  hanging out even more. Current obsession is Rust and distributed systems, but he tends to do JS from time to time too. '

      desc: 'Most people have at least vague idea of what a UI or industrial designer do... but game designers? What the heck do they do? Even other designers struggle with this. In his talk Allan will explain what these designers do and how they are contributing to the current tech & media landscape.'
      bio: 'Allan Cudicio is Game Designer at King. Previously involved in the business side of software development, he has now switched to full time design of mobile games. '
