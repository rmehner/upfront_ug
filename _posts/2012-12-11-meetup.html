  - title: 'Make the build go #F00 â€” Automated CSS testing'
    name: Simon Madine
    desc: >-
      Even in the biggest web apps built on continuous integration servers with
      automated deploys, CSS is often still being manually tested. Something can
      easily be missed or regressions can slip in and not be spotted until
      production.

          <br>

            As CSS is a declarative language, traditional automated testing
      techniques either don&#x2019;t apply or aren&#x2019;t sensible. This talk
      aims to give an overview of the techniques available for automated testing
      such as page render image diffs, reference-browser equality, frozen DOM
      structure comparisons. It will also cover some of the tools you can use to
      integrate automated CSS testing into your build pipeline.
