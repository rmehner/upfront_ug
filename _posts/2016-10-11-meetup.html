      desc: 'Almost a year ago Harry and three friends decided to found a new digital product and branding studio, called diesdas.digital. They thought they had it all figured out, but then everything turned out quite differently. Nevertheless (or because of that) it’s been going rather well and Harry will share a couple of early findings, which should be relevant for pretty much everyone working in digital.'

      picture:
      desc: 'In this talk Mischa will show how to use Lean Startup principles to verify concepts for side projects on the example of a web application which enables users to visualize their WhatsApp chats. While exporting chats is easy, WhatsApp makes it hard to convert the data into a standardized structured format. We will go through some technical issues and solutions implemented in the process of creating Chatvisualizer. Finally we’ll look at the challenges involved in the visual treatment of highly dynamic data such as chats and some ways to deal with them.'

When not working with clients, he is looking for technical and visual inspiration to built digital concepts upon – especially in the fields of social media and digital journalism.'
