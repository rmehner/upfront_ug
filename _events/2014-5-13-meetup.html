    <h4><span>Burak Son</span> Performance Matters: Mobile Websites</h4>
    <p>
      Have you ever thought whether users have smooth and fast experience on your mobile website? This talk aims to shed light on the factors that affect bad user experience on mobile web products. It will also guide you through how to get the best out of countless devices and platforms. The talk briefly covers the main practices for performance optimization in front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) as well as generic tips that need to be taken into account.

      How can you ensure that you are making informed design decisions and arenâ€™t wasting time on building the wrong thing? How can you maximise the decision making power that UX Design has? For all the jargon flying around regarding Agile Processes, Scrum Methodologies and Lean UX, there is surprisingly little guidance available on what it means to bring Design Thinking and User Centered Design into your daily grind when working on an established app. Building off of existing concepts, Allard proposes tweaking the workflow that UX Designers have in a Scrum team so as to maximise the impact that design has for the product.
