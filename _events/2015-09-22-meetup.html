      Recently, there's been a lot of talk about modularising UIs into components. Lewis will explore some strategies that allow you to do this, and introduce the css-modules project and how you can get started with it in your own projects. This talk will get you interested in modular UIs, and introduce you to some tools and methods that you can use to build your web applications in a loosely coupled way.

    Lewis is a Junior Front End Dev at HitFox group. He loves offline capable web apps, analysing processes, and modular design.

    <h4><span>Jonathon Bellew:</span> Making Friends and Beautiful Things With Your Browser</h4>
    <p>
      An overview of the wonderful tools the browser gives developers and designers right now to collaborate on creative projects. This talk focuses on concepts and opportunities rather than complex coding, and is appropriate for designers, developers, and anyone wanting to know how to collaborate across these two disciplines. It will feature real world examples from my recent work history, and is based on a talk I gave at decompress.com.au 2015.
