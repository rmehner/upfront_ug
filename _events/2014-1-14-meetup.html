    <h4><span>Michiel Slot:</span> Product Ownership: Captain Obvious speaks about owning and shipping</h4>
     <p>
       Are you a Product Owner? Maybe not by all definitions, though Michiel believe every developer or designer involved in a project is a Product Owner. Michiel found some obvious stuff about dealing with product ownership he will share with you.

       Michiel has lengthy experience both as project manager and frontend developer on projects large and small. He likes smooth user interfaces and appreciates nerdy tricks. Besides leading a team of interactive heads at Viacom he organises WebVisions Berlin 2014.

    Sass + mathematics. Many web developers nowadays use CSS preprocessors, and do simple calculations like ($a + $b) * $c in them. But we can do more. Much more: sin, cos, tan, … and calculate square roots like the ancient Babylonians. A short trip into geometry. Bring your rulers and compasses!
    </p>
    <p class="talk__bio">
      As a frontend developer on the whatever-first path, Gunnar aims at a better understanding between humans and machines. He helps organizing the World Usability Day Berlin and struggles not to forget how to play the guitar.
