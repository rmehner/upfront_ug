<p>
  Up.front 59 is coming up – join us on July 14th for the last meetup before the summer break! We’ll keep it short and sweet with only two talks, so there’ll be plenty of time to enjoy the weather with some drinks and discussions afterwards. But be prepared for some serious thought food brought to you by Lukas Rieder who will introduce you to visualisations and D3, and Gilberto Urutea who's going to explore complex systems.

    <h4><span>Gilberto Urueta:</span>Dealing with Complexity</h4>
    <p>We all have experienced these: Long hours of planning and forecasting that don’t lead to results, clients changing their mind from one day to another, decisions taken that seemed illogical. How can we explain all of that? In Gilberto’s talk we will learn about complex systems in order to understand the reason behind these situations. The talk will explore why learning more about complex system can be useful in your every day work.

    <h4><span>Lukas Rieder:</span> Object Constancy In Visualisations</h4>
    <p>
      Visualisations are the backbone of data driven story telling. In between the many ways to represent data nowadays, lies one fundamental principle of our perception to make visualisations comprehensible. The talk aims to dive into the idea behind object constancy and shows how D3.js can help you achieve this goal. Even if you are new to D3, this talk will have you covered.
