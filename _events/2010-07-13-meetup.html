    <h4><span>Sebastian Kippe:</span> On the future of Flash Pt. 2</h4>
    <p>
    This talk is a bit of the anti-thesis to Alex Feyerke’s Talk at our may meetup. Sebastian will tell us why he thinks that Alex sees Flash’s future a bit too bright and why the new tools around HTML5 will succeed over Flash.
