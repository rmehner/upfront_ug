  Hi Frondendeers (that’s like a buccaneer or a rocketeer, but with markup)! Join us on Tue, August 14, for up.front meetup number 29, with talks on design, some hopefully spirited discussion, enjoyable socializing and tasty drinks afterward.

    <h4><span>Jonas Knipper:</span> An outsider’s investigation of the Foursquare redesign</h4>
    <p>
       How did the Foursquare redesign end up where it is? A curious user looks at the effects of a changing market on a popular product and the reaction of users and media. Includes a discussion of new user requirements and how Foursquare tries to answer them, as well as inspiration taken from other apps and services shaping the UI landscape in 2012.

    <h4><span>Christoph Rauscher:</span> Self / Digital Self</h4>

    <p>
       Is our digital identity different from our analog one? The digital lifestyle is somehow changing our view on ourselves, and we have to cope with these transformations. Is that me inside this machine, or is it just a distorted portrayal? How do I reflect myself when there are different versions of me online? For his bachelor thesis, Christoph wants to explore how philosophy and self-reflection are connected to interaction design.
