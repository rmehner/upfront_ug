    <h4><span>Jeanny Wang:</span> Design for uncertainty</h4>
    <p>
      In today’s increasingly demanding, connected marketplace with ever-changing technological possibilities, uncertainty is no longer an exception, but a norm. Whereas build first, fail fast and often is the name of the game, this talk proposes and asks whether it’s possible to apply a fail forward approach using human-centric, collaborative methods of inclusion to connect with, rather than confront, uncertainty in today’s fast-paced business landscape.

    <h4><span>Jennifer Geacone-Cruz:</span> The not-so-Zen art of the Japanese website</h4>
    <p>
       Oceans of text, long load times; Japanese websites are hardly minimal and often not user-friendly. But why are Japanese websites, so, well... Japanese? The answer is very much cultural and only a little bit technical. This talk will provide a foot in the sliding shoji door of the sometimes frustrating, but fascinating world of Japanese websites and frontend.

    <h4><span>Bastian Albers:</span> Responsive Web Applications, Javascript and Media Queries</h4>
    <p>
    Responsive Web Design has been winning the internet. For content heavy sites adding some more CSS wrapped in some media queries works surprisingly well. But in web applications there are some technical challenges you can't (yet) solve with pure CSS. After a quick walkthrough of RWD basics we discuss some possibilities how to keep the design in the CSS and use JS to help only where needed.
