    <h4><span>Emma Rose Metcalfe</span>Social Objects - the centre of our universe</h4>
    <p>
    Whether it’s photo sharing, loops or tweets, the social object reigns queen of the web. Starting with Jyri Engeström as our centre point I’ll walk through findings from our own development in seeking the balance between accessible and precious design around social objects. How can we design platforms that lower barriers to create objects with long term social value?
