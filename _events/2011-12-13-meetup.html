 This month we’ll be hosting a crowd-based experiment in collaborative consumption (of cookies and drinks) in the festive atmosphere of a bar named after an actor known for playing Dracula, Santa’s arch nemesis. So it all makes sense.

 Come and join us at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=217650843440300277520.0004b2f26bdc18ca851eb&msa=0&ll=52.497419,13.424527&spn=0.00068,0.001742">Lugosi (corner of Reichenberger and Manteuffel in Kreuzberg)</a> at 8pm on December 13, enjoy some beers and Cola from Corsica (seriously, they have that there). We’ll provide a variety of cookies and other portable nomables, but feel free to bring some of your own as well. See you all there!
