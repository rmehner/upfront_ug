    <h4><span>Johan Dettmar:</span> Creativity, How?</h4>
    <p>
      Everyone can be creative, most of us know this by now. Thus it is a skill, that can be improved, rather than a born-with-it talent.<br>But how do we get more creative? Are we putting ourselves in the right environment and mindset in order to get the most juice out of our brains? Johan will talk about methods and ideas around the topic of improving your creativity as an individual or group.

    <h4><span>Ferdinand Vogler:</span> Getting Web-Typography Just Right With Sass</h4>
    <p>
    “95% of the information on the web is written language” (Oliver Reichenstein). Striving for typographic structure, hierachy and legibility across various devices should be a must in every designer’s skillset. In this talk Ferdinand will explain the basics of well-set type and how Sass can be a powerful ally to achieve that.

    <p class="talk__bio">
      Ferdinand is a communication design student in fifth semester at HTW Berlin and started his work as a design and web-development freelancer just over a year ago.
