  Join us at co.up on Valentine’s Day for our first event of 2012. co.up will be freshly equipped with the new crowd-funded megafridge of endless cold drinks, so having our speakers put new stuff in your head will be even more pleasant. Here’s what we’ve got for you:

    <h4><span>Georgi Kobilarov and Philipp Steinacher:</span> Designing &amp; Developing the Urbany App - What We Have Learned</h4>
    <p>
      Urbany is a new iPhone App we launched last week
      that integrates many of your favorite location apps into one interface.
      <a href="http://netzwertig.com/2012/02/08/cafe-restaurant-und-ausgehtipps-urbany
      -ist-das-ultimative-empfehlungs-mashup/">Netzwertig.com</a> called it "the ultimate location mashup". In this talk we will share our experiences designing and developing Urbany.
      We will walk you through the rationale of some of our design decisions
      (both the intentional and the incidental ones), we will talk about
      climbing to top of the travel category in the German App Store in just
      48 hours, and we will confuse correlation with causation a lot.

    <h4><span>Alex Feyerke:</span> The dark mysteries of the Chrome DevTools</h4>
    <p class="lightning_talk">
      If you’ve never ventured further than console.log() and your general notion of DevTools and Firebug is “yeah, this is neat, but it could be a lot neater”, then this is for you. Useful functions you’d never stumble across on your own and more keyboard shortcuts than you can shake a stick at.
