    <h4><span>Malte Müller:</span> More pixels or none at all. Designing interfaces for better screens.</h4>
    <p>
      For once, Apple may have actually gotten it right with their
      advertising: The iPhone 4 changed everything. At least, if you’re an
      interface designer. Dealing with different resolutions and screen
      sizes adds another dimension to both conceptual and technical
      interface design. My talk provides some basic thoughts and approaches
      concerning this issue.
