  In June we have talks by Martin Spindler, Horia Dragomir and Alex Feyerke. As always, up.front takes place at <a href="http://co-up.de/">co.up co-working</a> in Kreuzberg. <strong>NEW: For the first time we’ll use co.up’s brand new rooms in the third floor. This means more space for you and less stairs to walk.</strong>

    <p>

But this emerging new class of “computers”, often dubbed the Internet of Things, demands new interfaces that accommodate those new capabilities. What does it mean to design for the Internet of Things, then?
