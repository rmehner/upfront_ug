<p>Celebrating our 50th meetup: Join us for up.front.ug on September 9th at co.up!
It’s official: we’re old! 50 years of up.front! Well, nearly. After more than four years and about 100 different speakers from all over the world and what feels like most of Berlin’s tech scene, we now reconvene for a celebratory recap with some of our veteran speakers, one from each of the past three years. So please join us on Tuesday, the 9th of September, for the 50th edition of our humble little meetup. We’re happy to welcome Emma, Tim and Tiffany as our anniversary speakers:

      Charts! Maps! Numbers! Deep analytical insights into meetup demographics! Awards! And… er… ah! Historical photographs of the earliest recorded up.front meetups. They’re practically cave paintings. Ok, daguerrotypes. Also: Brownies! Prosecco! Balloons! And we totally didn’t open that Prosecco yet, we promise.

      The up.front team is a band of fearless red pandas, roaming the skies in their solar-powered meetup airship, delivering frontend fun to all sorts of tiny little islands. I may be mixing things up with TaleSpin, though.

      Many applications restrict access to some features for some users for various reasons. For example: Only premium users get access to extra features. Only supervisors can edit product categories. I went on a hunt to gather patterns and techniques for handling the logic around user capabilities in client-side apps. Join me on a safari through the approaches, and I’ll tell you what I have learned.
