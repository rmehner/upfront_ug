    <h4><span>Marco Hamersma</h4>
    <p>
      Although we spend lots of time and money on designing our interfaces, we don’t always pay the same kind of attention to sounds. Marco’s talk is about finding out when to use sound and what sounds are good to use in your interface.

      Marco is a developer and UX designer currently working as an intern at SoundCloud.

    <h4><span>Malte Müller:</span> Changing tires on a moving truck: Agile interface design</h4>
    <p>
      Agile development has long become the standard way of creating web applications. Still, many teams struggle to integrate interface design and other visual disciplines into their workflow. For the past five months, we have been one of them. As we developed a web application from ground up, we had to figure out how to keep developers and designers in sync – without slowing down the project. In this talk we’d like to share our learnings on how to set up and run a successful team with a maximum of agility – under real-world conditions. Hop the truck and keep your wrenches ready.
