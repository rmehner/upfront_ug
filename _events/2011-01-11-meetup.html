  It’s the first meetup of 2011, and we’re going to get the year started with an amazing programme.
  Did you make new year’s resolutions to improve your workflow, or finally learn about that helpful tool you always wanted to use in your projects?
  We’ve got some talks to help you out.

    <h4><span>Tiffany Conroy:</span> How to Build a Bookmarklet</h4>

    <p>
      Get ideas and learn the tricks to make your own bookmarklets, and
      learn how some of the popular ones work (e.g. <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/share_bookmarklet">Share on Twitter</a>,
      <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Read Later</a>, and <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">Readability</a>.)
      <br />
      What is a bookmarklet? A bookmarklet is a way to inject a JavaScript
      into any web page. Don’t be intimidated! This practical talk teaches
      you step-by-step how to create and distribute tiny (or big!)
      applications that can be used on any website.
