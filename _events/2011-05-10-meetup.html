    <h4><span>Stephen Coles:</span> Cure for the Common Font — A Web Designer’s Introduction to Typeface Selection</h4>
    <p>
      Now that web designers suddenly face the challenge (and delight) of choosing fonts from an ever-growing selection, it’s a good time to recommend some basic principles for making wise type choices.

    <h4><span>Gearóid O’Rourke:</span> Taking print design online</h4>
    <p>
    Newspapers are dying. Print is dead. All hail the online revolution! It has felled the inky beasts. Oh the confidence of teenagers. Web design is a discipline in it’s adolescence — the classic teenager; all existential angst, bad fashion choices, mood swings and earnest attempts at “cool”. It has rightly rejected the mistakes, constraints and pitfalls of “fuddy-duddy” print design, but has forgotten that old-man print still has more than a few things to teach.<br />
    Gearóid spent his teenage years in the world of newspapers. As the youngest designer at Ireland’s oldest newspaper he learned print design from the old hands. Teaching himself web design at the same time, he became fascinated by the insights a grounding in print design can offer to the web designer who is willing to listen. Gearóid will explore these insights under 3 headings – process, philosophy and practicalities.
