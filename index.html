        Up.front is a free event, and you do not have to register anywhere. However it gets packed sometimes. Doors open at 7:30pm, talks start at {{event.time}}. Arrive on time to make sure you get a seat! After the talks there’s time for conversations with tasty drinks or snacks at <a href="http://www.kremanski.de/">Kremanski</a>, a cosy coffeeshop and bistro just around the corner from our venue.
      <br>
         We always need volunteers who help us to prepare the venue (and build it back after the meetups). This takes ca. 15 minutes and is fun – arrive at 7pm if you want to help us.

        <i>Accessibility</i>: If you would like to use the elevator, please tweet <a href="http://twitter.com/upfront_ug/">@upfront_ug</a> when you arrive.
