        Up.front is a free event, and you do not have to register anywhere. However it gets packed sometimes. Doors open at 7pm, talks do not start before 7:30pm. Come early to make sure you get a seat! As usual, after the talks thereâ€™s time for conversations and tasty, discounted drinks at <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/aapKr">Lugosi</a>, a cosy bar in walking distance from our venue.
