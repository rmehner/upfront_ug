         And we’re back! Our 30th meetup is drawing ever closer, and with it, our collective mid-life crisis. But fear not, Berlin’s dazzling tech scene is currently spoiling us with amazing conferences (jsconf.eu and reject.js, and there’s Javascript helicopters in there somewhere as well) and attracting smart beings from all around the globe, some of which will be speaking at up.front! This one should be excellent.
         <br>
         Hover into co.up’s third floor at 7:30 for talks and general interestingness, and join us later at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.497459,13.424525&num=1&vpsrc=0&hl=de&ie=UTF8&t=m&z=18">Lugosi</a> for casual lounging and tasty, discounted drinks.

        Hi Frondendeers (that’s like a buccaneer or a rocketeer, but with markup)! Join us on Tuesday, August the 14th, for up.front meetup number 29, with talks on design, some hopefully spirited discussion, enjoyable socializing and tasty drinks afterward.

             How did the Foursquare redesign end up where it is? A curious user looks at the effects of a changing market on a popular product and the reaction of users and media. Includes a discussion of new user requirements and how Foursquare tries to answer them, as well as inspiration taken from other apps and services shaping the UI landscape in 2012.

          <p>
             Is our digital identity different from our analog one? The digital lifestyle is somehow changing our view on ourselves, and we have to cope with these transformations. Is that me inside this machine, or is it just a distorted portrayal? How do I reflect myself when there are different versions of me online? For his bachelor thesis, Christoph wants to explore how philosophy and self-reflection are connected to interaction design.

      <p>And we’re back, and I’m confused, because I’m tzping this on up.front founder @kriesse’s US keyboard, who has returned from San Francisco for a month! In other news, our central theme this week seems to be “high resolution”, with one talk about publishing a magazine, and a second one about resolution-independent front-end work in the wake of even more pixel-density diversity. On a completely different note, RailsGirls will be stopping by to tell us about their awesome project.</p>
      <p>
        As always, up.front takes place at <a href="http://co-up.de/">co.up co-working</a> in Kreuzberg. <strong>PLEASE NOTE: We’re now located in co.up’s brand new rooms in the third floor. This means more space for you and less stairs to climb.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>If you’ve got anything to add for this month’s meetup or any talk ideas for the next months, please get in touch via <a href="http://twitter.com/upfront_ug">Twitter</a> or on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/up.front.ug">Facebook</a>.

          <h4><span>Kai Brach:</span> From digital to paper—publishing a print mag about pixel people</h4>
          <p>
            At a time when print is declared dead and traditional media outlets struggle to make a buck, Kai decided to move from designing websites to publishing a print magazine. Offscreen is an old-fashioned periodical on high-quality paper, exploring the life and work of people that create websites and apps. It tells the less obvious human stories of creativity, passion and hard work that hide behind every interface. Kai talks about the whys and hows of his new magazine and offers insight into today’s challenges as an indie publisher.
          </p>
          <p class="speaker_info">
            Originally from Germany, Kai now lives in Melbourne, Australia, though, he can be found in various places around the globe when live becomes too repetitive. He’s currently taking a break from his web design career to publish a magazine about digital creators.

        <li>
          <h4><span>Francesco Kirchhoff:</span> The death of pixels – Designing for high-density displays</h4>
          <p>
            New ultra-high resolution displays (like the Retina displays touted by Apple in their iOS devices and new MacBook Pro) are changing the way our designs get displayed, requiring us to change some of our development approaches. We’ll look back how the use of space and absolute/relative sizes in design have been translated into digital until now and how it will be done in the feature, presenting some viable solutions to make our sites and apps look good across devices.
          </p>

          <p class="speaker_info">
            Rome-born, Berlin-based Francesco is a caffeine addict who toils away day and sometimes night as a freelance UX designer and project manager for various web agencies and startups in Berlin in order to support his tragic habit. He tries his best not to increase the pervasive ugliness and thoughtlessness, for bad design makes him weep.
