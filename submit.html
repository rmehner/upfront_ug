<h2>About Up.front</h2>
<p>
  Up.front is a meetup for the web design community in Berlin. We’re motivated by the fact that we have become a place for everybody interested in shaping the web – since 7 years. Up.front has been called the friendliest meetup. We’re a diverse community of designers, developers, coordinators, and everybody contributing to building and improving the web. The aim is to enable a dialogue between and about the creative, the technical and human sides of our field.

  We organize two meetup seasons per year. Each meetup holds three to four speaker slots. The lineup is curated by the organizer team.
