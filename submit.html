<h2>About Speaking At Up.front</h2>
<h5>Audience</h5>
<p>
  Up.front is a meetup for the web design community in Berlin. Our audience is a diverse mix of designers, frontend developers, concept, UX and communications people.</p>
<h5>Topics</h5>
<p>
  Talks at up.front discuss a wide range of topics in the field of web, design, front end development, and everything inbetween. up.front isn’t a traditional usergroup where we discuss one specific language or technology. Instead, we’re interested in topics that aren’t as easily classified, but can maybe be described as "in-depth discourse at the intersections of design and web technology".
  <br>
  A few examples of what we’re interested in: Design theory and methods, user experience, storytelling in products, the web design industry and its culture, typography for the web, HTML, CSS, SVG, illustration and animations for the web, web performance, professional challenges in design teams … you get the idea. Our talks aim to be beginner-friendly when discussing technologies or showing code examples. For advanced web development topics, we suggest submitting your talk to the <a href="http://berlinjs.org/">BerlinJS meetup</a>.
</p>
<h5>Experience Level</h5>
<p>We’re open to anyone, from bloody beginners to conference veterans. <a href="http://weareallaweso.me/">Here are some good reasons to start speaking at meetups</a>.</p>
<h5>Language</h5>
<p>
  All talks are in English.
</p>
<h5>Talk Duration</h5>
<p>
  Talks should be no longer than 15-20 minutes. Please make absolutely sure to keep your talk within this limit! Up.front aims to present short, focused ideas, and is not the right format for a 40 minute presentation.
</p>
<h5>Audience Questions</h5>
<p>
  We do not take questions from the audience – there’ll be time for discussion during breaks and at the end of the meetup.
</p>
<h5>Slides and Equipment</h5>
<p>
  There’s a projector (1280x800 native resolution) with HDMI, VGA and Mini DisplayPort connectors, and the choice between a wireless microphone headset and a wired hand mic. We can also get audio from your machine into the speakers via AirPlay or 3.5mm audio jack, if needed.
