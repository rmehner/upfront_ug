<h2>About Up.front</h2>
<p>
  Up.front is a meetup for the web design community in Berlin. We’re motivated by the fact that we have become a place for everybody interested in shaping the web to come together – since 7 years. Up.front has been called the friendliest meetup and we dig that. We’re a diverse community of designers, developers, coordinators, and everybody contributing to building and improving the web. The aim is to enable a dialogue between and about the creative, the technical and human sides of our field.
</p>
<p>
  We organize two meetup seasons per year. Each meetup holds three to four speaker slots. The lineup is curated by the organizer team. <strong>Slots are still available for all dates of the upcoming season:</strong>
