<h2>About Up.front</h2>
<p>
  Up.front is a meetup for the web design community in Berlin. We’re motivated by the fact that we have become a place for everybody interested in shaping the web to come together. We’ve been called the friendliest meetup and we dig that. We’re a diverse community of designers, developers, coordinators, and everybody contributing to building and improving the web. We aim to enable a dialogue between and about the creative, the technical and human sides of our field.
</p>
<p>
  We organize two meetup seasons per year. Each meetup holds three to four speaker slots available that are curated by the organizer team. <strong>We’re now looking for potential speakers for all dates of the upcoming season!</strong>

<h5>Who speaks at Up.front?</h5>
<p>
  Since the very first meetup at Co.Up – seven years ago – we’ve seen and heard a broad variety of speakers at our meetup. Up.front is open to all experience levels and perspectives on our key topics, to experts, all rounders, career switchers or beginners. This perfectly describes our audience as well!
</p>
<h5>Your turn!</h5>
<p>
  Sounds like you found the perfect meetup? Get in touch! We’re very interested in your ideas, whether it’s just an early draft or a polished talk. Contact us via the form below!
</p>
<h5>Not fully convinced yet?</h5>
<p>
  Here are the top reasons to speak at Up.front:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pass on your knowledge to an <strong>open-minded, friendly and diverse
  </strong> web crowd</li>
  <li>Present the projects or products you and your team put so much work into</li>
  <li><strong>Meet people</strong> like you and different from you to discuss topics that you care about</li>
  <li>Gain experience in public speaking while having fun doing it</li>
  <li>Give and take: give a talk and take part in a great community</li>
  <li>The organizers are always there for questions, and give the feedback and support you need</li>
</ul>
<h3>Topics</h3>
<p>
  We’re interested in topics that can be described as <strong>"in-depth discourse at the intersections of design and web technology"</strong>. To list just a few: Design theory and methods, user experience, storytelling in products, the web design industry and its culture, typography for the web, HTML, CSS, SVG, illustration and animations for the web, web performance, professional challenges in design teams… we’re sure you’ve got a bunch more.
</p>
<h5>Language</h5>
<p>
  All talks are in English.
</p>
<h5>Talk Duration</h5>
<p>
  Talks should be no longer than 15-20 minutes. Please make absolutely sure to keep your talk within this limit! Up.front aims to present short, focused ideas, and is not the right format for a 40 minute presentation.
</p>
<h5>Audience Questions</h5>
<p>
  We do not take questions from the audience – there’ll be time for discussion during breaks and at the end of the meetup.
</p>
<h5>Slides and Equipment</h5>
<p>
  There’s a projector (1280x800 native resolution) with HDMI, VGA and Mini DisplayPort connectors, and the choice between a wireless microphone headset and a wired hand mic. We can also get audio from your machine into the speakers via AirPlay or 3.5mm audio jack, if needed.
